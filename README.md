# Examples and Presentation for "React Native and Expo: Native Apps without the Native Pain" at CodeMash 2019

## Code example
This is a very basic example app, demonstrating an inbox with a chat interface. Demonstrates navigation, styling, and wiring up to a (fake) API.

### Prerequisites for running the example
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is installed (you could go without it, of course, but directions assume you have it)
* Expo CLI is installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
* The Expo app is installed on your phone (ignore if you're using the iOS simulator)
[Also see Expo's directions for getting started](https://expo.io/learn)

### Starting the bundler for the first time
1. In the terminal, `cd` to the project directory.
2. Run `yarn` to restore dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start running the app.

### Running the app in the iOS simulator or Android emulator
1. Once `expo start` kicks off and you see the QR code on the screen and directions for running, press `i` for the iOS simulator or `a`for the Android emulator.

### Running on an Android device
1. Open the Expo app on your device.
2. Go to the projects tab.
3. Open up the QR code scanner and scan the code that appears in the terminal.

### Running on an iOS device
1. Once `expo start` kicks off and you see the QR code on the screen, press `s` to create an account or sign into an existing account.
2. On the iOS Expo app, sign into the same Expo account.
3. In the projects tab, you'll see your currently streaming app. Tap on the app and it will start running.

## Or just try the Snack
You can run (almost) the same project in Expo Snack. Just go to the Snack, sign in/ create an Expo account, press the Share button in Snack, and follow the directions from there.
